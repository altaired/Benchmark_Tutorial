## Executable Tutorials

The concept: you create an executable tutorial about a specific technology related to Devops. You deliver your tutorial on an appropriate platform, such as [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/), [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) or similar. If the tutorial runs locally, the tutorial must run on Linux.

An executable tutorial is not a youtube video.
